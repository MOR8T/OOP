## Encapsulation
#### Encapsulation is the bundling of data and the methods that act on that data such that access to that data is restricted from outside the bundle, or as Alan Kay describes it, “local retention and protection and hiding of state-process.” In OOP, that means that an object stores its state privately, and only the object’s methods have access to change it.
